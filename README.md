## Podcast resources
* https://syntax.fm/ - a lot of small bites of technical discussion and exploring new features in JS or new libraries and tools. Good for keeping up to date on what’s new in web-dev. Can be overly optimistic about new frameworks and technologies.
* https://reactpodcast.simplecast.fm - more about learning a developer mindset, guests are often asked about their thought processes and decisions. Tries to bring unique and interesting projects and developers and issues to the forefront.
* https://shoptalkshow.com - a bit of a wider focus than syntax and react podcast - discusses JS/HTML/CSS of all kinds - less antagonistic toward older frameworks, and more cautious of new frameworks.
